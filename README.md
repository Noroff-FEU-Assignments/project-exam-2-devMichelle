# Reflection

This assignment was challenging but fun to work on. All the planning and design of the project went well, this is were i feel I can be more creative an try out different consepts and design, though I often end up making some changes under development when i see what works an not and get a better feel of the flow of the pages. 
I ran into some of problems along the way and learned a lot from problemsolving (along whith some frustration)  
I challenged my self with using Tailwind and Typescript wich I havent used on bigger projects before. Typescript especially gave me some headaches along the way. The project might have run a little smoother if i had stuck to regular javaScript and a CSS Framework that i was more familiar with.
I am happy with the design of the project, all though there is some features and placings i would make changes to.
There is also some functionality i wish was better and that i probably will work more on later on. 

Some of the changes i would do: 
- I would make the posts wider, i think this would look better from a design perspective. 
- Have the option to react to the post on the same page as the comments. 
- I struggled to get the reply comment to show up correctly underneath the original comment. 
- Im not happy with the reaction picker on the posts. 
- Would change the options button to not have the hoverfunction and also have a confirmation box before deleting posts. 
- implement the ability to edit your posts. 
- have the opportunity to upload images using URL

Im am also not happy with my folder and code structure so i might re-structure this at some point. But I didn't take the chance on doing this now and risk breaking the whole project before deadline.
